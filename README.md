# Wordle_Python
## its wordle in python
### How to play
Run main.py
For best gameplay experience, run on a compiler that can process ASCII color codes (terminal, VSCode, etc)

## What the other files do
wordslistgetter.py creates a new wordslist.txt (text file with all the words) if it has been deleted somehow. It takes a long time to run.
Add your own 5 letter words to wordslist.txt if you want more words
