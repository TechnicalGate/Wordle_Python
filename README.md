### How to play
Install a Python IDE (e.g Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Get /path/to/requirements.txt by getting info of requirements.txt and copying the path

Run "pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt" in terminal

Run main.py


## What the other files do
wordslistgetter.py creates a new wordslist.txt (text file with all the words) if it has been deleted somehow. It takes a long time to run.
Add your own 5 letter words to wordslist.txt if you want more words
